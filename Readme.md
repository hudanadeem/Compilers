# ⚙️ C-Minus Compiler (Java)

A full compiler for a simplified C-like language called **C-Minus**, written in Java. The compiler supports three main stages:

1. **Parsing**: Converts `.cm` source files into abstract syntax trees (ASTs)
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Builds symbol tables and performs type checking
3. **Code Generation**: Outputs assembly code in Tiny Machine (TM) language

## 🧠 Project Structure

The compiler is structured in stages. You can run each stage individually or run the full compiler:

| Stage | Flag | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Parser only | `-a` | `<filename>.abs` (syntax tree) |
| Parser + Semantic Analyzer | `-s` | `<filename>.abs`, `<filename>.sym` (symbol table) |
| Full Compiler | `-c` | `<filename>.abs`, `<filename>.sym`, `<filename>.tm` (assembly code) |
